# Project Overview

The Pizza Menu project started as a simple SPA displaying 7 menu items from a
fictional pizzeria. This project was apart of Jonas Schmedtman's React course
and aimed to teach the basics of Components and State.

## Changes

This project extension by Cole Caccamise plans to expand the functionality of
the Pizza Menu by converting it to a full-stack SPA with cart functionality.
